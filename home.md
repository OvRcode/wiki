		* smooth check-ins keep the bus on time and get everyone to the mountain as quickly as possible.

###  My friend and I choose different pick up locations….Can we be on the same bus?
* Due to the large number of people OvRride services on any trip we may schedule multiple busses
	* most of which take different routes through the city
	* routes are determined the morning of each trip and are subject to change for many reasons.
* OvRride can only guarantee you and your friend(s) will be on the same bus if you all get on at the same pickup location.

### What time does the bus leave the mountain?
* **4:30pm SHARP**
	* except for:
		* Camelback Fridays **10pm**
		* Camelback Saturdays **8pm**
		* Camelback Sundays **6pm**
	* Last chair at most mountains is 4pm, so if you're quick you can probably grab last chair and make the bus on time.
	* We have a policy of not leaving anyone behind, but please be courteous and arrive on time
		* timely departures help get everyone home at a reasonable hour.

###  What time do we get back to the city?

### Can you drop me off on my corner? It’s on the way.
* We **CANNOT** accommodate any personal drop off locations. 
* We have permits for pick up and drop off locations and can be subject to heavy fines for stopping elsewhere.

### Are there any stops on the way up?
* For Catskills or Pocono Mountains, no, since the trips are not very long
* For VT, we try to make a brief stop about half way to the mountains at a rest area
	* Our goal is to get to the mountain as early as possible and enjoy the most of the day

### Are there any stops on the way back?
* Coming back from VT we typically make 2 stops:
	* The first is before we hit the highway to stock up on snacks, beverages, or anything you may need for the trip.
	* The second is at the same rest stop we visit in the morning.

		* Rates are based on day trips
		* Rates will vary for weekend or longer trips
	* Please inform your trip leader in the morning that you will not be returning on the bus ride home
		* We take pride in making sure we don’t abandon any of our customers at the mountain
		* This will save them the trouble of looking for you at the end of the day and possibly holding up the bus. 
		*  If you plan on returning to NYC with us on another date, you will need to book that return bus ride separately and email [info@OvRride.com](mailto:info@ovrride.com) to let us know of your plan so we know to expect you on the bus ride home.

### I’m booked for a day trip, can I stay there overnight, and come back another day with OvR?
* You absolutely can choose to stay at the mountain rather than come back on the same day
	*  You will have to book two separate tickets for each day you’ll be traveling and pay the amount of both of these trips.

		*  Purchase the Bus and Lift Package (You can add lessons, rentals, etc.) for Saturday as well as for Sunday. 
		*  Inform the trip leader you will not be returning with the bus Saturday. 
		*  On Sunday you will need to meet the trip leader for that day who will provide you with your mountain product for Sunday as well as inform you which bus to board for your return trip.
	*  Email [info@OvRride.com](mailto:info@ovrride.com) of your plans so we can provide our trip leaders with your contact information and make the proper arrangements.
