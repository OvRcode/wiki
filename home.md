###  My friend and I choose different pick up locations….Can we be on the same bus?

	* most of which take different routes through the city

	* except for:
		* Camelback Fridays **10pm**
		* Camelback Saturdays **8pm**
		* Camelback Sundays **6pm**
	* Last chair at most mountains is 4pm, so if you're quick you can probably grab last chair and make the bus on time.

		* timely departures help get everyone home at a reasonable hour.

###  What time do we get back to the city?

### Are there any stops on the way up?
