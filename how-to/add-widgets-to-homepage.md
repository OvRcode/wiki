# Widgets
[What is a widget anyway?](https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/widgets/)

Most of the elements on the home page are widgets. By making these elements widgets we can easily re-organize elements and change the layout of the page more easlily.

On the left side of the screen the grey boxes contain all the widgets available on the site. On the right side of the screen you see the areas of the site where widgets can be assigned.
**Note:** Widgets can also be assigned to an **Arbitrary** category. From there you can use the widget's **shortcode** to embed it in a post or a page.
