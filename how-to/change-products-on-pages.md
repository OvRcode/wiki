# Missing a product?
The most likely culprit for a product not showing up under a woocommerce category shortcode is that the product doesn't have the right category assigned. 
Before modifying the page check that the missing product has the correct category assigned and also check that the category **slug** is as expected.

If you're missing a lot of products and this is a new page double check that the slug on the page is the same as the category slug used on the products.
