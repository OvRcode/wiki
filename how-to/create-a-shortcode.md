# What is a shortcode?
> Since Version 2.5 WordPress supports so called Shortcodes. They have been introduced for creating macros to be used in a post's content.


See [WordPress Codex Shortcode Page](https://codex.wordpress.org/shortcode) for more details.

On our site we mostly use shortcodes for tab content, like the tabs on products, destination pages and bus stop pages.

### Tldr;
Shortcodes let you save bits of text and HTML and use them in pages, posts and possibly as widgets.

**Shortcode titles must be unique. If two shortcodes share the same title you might not get the one you expect when you use the shortcode.**
