<!-- TITLE: Create A Shortcode -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Shortcodes are used to display content in various places on the site -->

# What is a shortcode?
> Since Version 2.5 WordPress supports so called Shortcodes. They have been introduced for creating macros to be used in a post's content.


See [WordPress Codex Shortcode Page](https://codex.wordpress.org/shortcode) for more details.

On our site we mostly use shortcodes for tab content, like the tabs on products, destination pages and bus stop pages.

### Tldr;
Shortcodes let you save bits of text and HTML and use them in pages, posts and possibly as widgets.

# Why shortcodes?
We use shortcodes for data that needs to be displayed in multiple places. When a shortcode is used you only need to edit the information in one place and then all the instances of the shortcode show the new content automatically.

# Go to shortcode Page
![All Shortcodes](/uploads/all-shortcodes.png "All Shortcodes")
From the admin menu on the left side of the screen click **All Shortcode** from the **Shortcode** heading.

# Before adding a new shortcode
**Shortcode titles must be unique. If two shortcodes share the same title you might not get the one you expect when you use the shortcode.**
It is a good idea to search for the shortcode you intend to create to make sure it doesn't already exist.

The search box is in the upper right hand corner of the shortcode screen.

# Add new shortcode
