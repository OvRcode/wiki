# What is a shortcode?
> Since Version 2.5 WordPress supports so called Shortcodes. They have been introduced for creating macros to be used in a post's content.


See [WordPress Codex Shortcode Page](https://codex.wordpress.org/shortcode) for more details.

## Tldr;
Shortcodes let you save bits of text and HTML and use them in pages, posts and possibly as widgets.
