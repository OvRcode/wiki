# What is a shortcode?
> Since Version 2.5 WordPress supports so called Shortcodes. They have been introduced for creating macros to be used in a post's content. For examples of shortcodes and how to use them, see WordPress.com Shortcodes, though some shortcodes featured there are exclusive to WordPress.com.
See [WordPress Codex Shortcode Page](https://codex.wordpress.org/shortcode) for more details.
