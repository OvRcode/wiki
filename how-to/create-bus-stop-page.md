# Page vs Pickup location
Pickup locations are custom post types used by the trips plugin to store information about bus stops. This information is used by the plugin to display names and stop times on the booking forms and also used by the lists to find information about the stops.

A bus stop page is a page that is generated by hand using a template. When we add a bus stop to a product we also add a category to the product with the same name.
