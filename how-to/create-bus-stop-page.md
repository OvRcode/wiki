<!-- TITLE: Create Bus Stop Page -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Generate the public page for a bus stop -->

#### Page vs Pickup location
Pickup locations are custom post types used by the trips plugin to store information about bus stops. This information is used by the plugin to display names and stop times on the booking forms and also used by the lists to find information about the stops.

A bus stop page is a page that is generated by hand using a template. When we add a bus stop to a product we also add a category to the product with the same name.

Click **save draft** when done.

![Page Attributes](/uploads/page-attributes.png "Page Attributes")

# Set WooCommerce Product shortcode
In the body of the **Page** you need to add a **shortcode** which will display a category of products from the shop.
You are going to need to know the **slug** for the category in this short code. The **slug** is a version of the **product category name** in which the name is lower case and the spaces are replaced with dashes.
Ex: 
Category: My Category Slug: my-category
