# Types of products
WooCommerce has four built in product types and we run a custom product type for trips.

## Simple Product
Simple products are the basic WooCommerce product. You can assign shipping info like dimensions, set prices, set stock levels etc.
In our shop items like physical products (hats, beanies, coozies, goggles) would be simple products.
