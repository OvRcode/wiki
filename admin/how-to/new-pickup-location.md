# Log into admin dashboard
[Visit https://ovrride.com/wp-admin](https://ovrride.com/wp-admin)

Your account will need to have either **Administrator**, **Shop manager** or **OvR Staff** roles assigned to create products. Contact [devops@ovrride.com](mailto:devops@ovrride.com) if you need to have your existing account upgraded.

From the menu on the left side of the admin dashboard hover over **Pickup Locations** and click **Add location**. 

*You can also click on the **Pickup Locations** heading and then when the **All Pickup Locations** page loads the sub menu will show under the heading.*

# Add new Location Page

# Set title
![Location Title](/uploads/location-title.png "Location Title")

The title is displayed both in the admin interace when creating/editing trips and also on the product booking forms. Make sure the title is acurate, descriptive and the same as other titles for the same stop for consistency. 

# Set time
![Location Time](/uploads/location-time.png "Location Time")

Times are set in 12hr time using a field with specific formatting.

# Set address
![Location Address](/uploads/location-address.png "Location Address")

This is the street address for the stop. It's important this is right so that guests get the right addresses on the booking forms and on confirmation emails.
Addresses need to be in the following format in this field: 
123 fake st, new york, ny 11206

# Set cross streets
![Location Cross Streets](/uploads/location-cross-streets.png "Location Cross Streets")

The cross streets field can be used to help guests find this location. Often you would enter things like nearest street corner but sometimes it's useful, like at union square, to call out that the address is in the North West Corner of the park. Usually it would be a value like **Broadway & 86th st**

# Cost
![Location Cost](/uploads/location-cost.png "Location Cost")

This field is rarely used. This could be used to charge extra for a certain stop or bus costs could be moved from a package to the stop.
Values in this field should either be whole numbers 1,2,3 or decimal numbers 13.20, 11.99, etc. Dollar signs should **NOT** be added to this field.
